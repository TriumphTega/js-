# Lunaris App - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Lunaris Not Updating from Database

**Problem:** Lunaris tokens weren't loading or saving correctly from Firebase.

**Root Cause:**
- localStorage was being removed during data load, causing conflicts
- Firebase saves weren't being prioritized over localStorage
- No clear logging to debug data flow

**Solution:**
- Removed `localStorage.removeItem('colonyData')` from data loading
- Made Firebase the PRIMARY data source, only fall back to localStorage if Firebase fails
- Added comprehensive logging for data loads and saves
- Better error handling with visual feedback

**Files Changed:** `dashboard.html:558-576, 1174-1225`

**Test:** Sign in ‚Üí Complete a task ‚Üí Check Lunaris increases ‚Üí Reload page ‚Üí Lunaris should persist

### 2. ‚úÖ XP Not Updating

**Problem:** XP wasn't being saved or displayed correctly after earning.

**Root Cause:**
- XP saves were silent with no user feedback
- No validation that saves completed successfully
- Poor error handling

**Solution:**
- Added detailed logging: Shows old XP ‚Üí new XP on every update
- Added in-game modal notifications when XP is earned
- Better error handling with user-friendly messages
- Visual confirmation of XP gains

**Files Changed:** `dashboard.html:646-682`

**Test:** Complete a daily check-in ‚Üí Should see "+15 XP" modal ‚Üí Go to Console page ‚Üí XP should be displayed

### 3. ‚úÖ "No Permission" Error on Login

**Problem:** Modal error appears saying "No permission" when logging in, then login succeeds anyway.

**Root Cause:** Firebase Realtime Database rules were too restrictive or not configured, blocking initial data reads.

**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive Firebase Realtime Database security rules
- Rules allow users to read/write their own data only
- Admins can manage admin lists and task rules
- All authenticated users can access chat and task rules

**Files Created:** `FIREBASE-DATABASE-RULES.txt`

**Action Required:**
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select "Realtime Database" (NOT Firestore!)
3. Go to "Rules" tab
4. Copy rules from `FIREBASE-DATABASE-RULES.txt`
5. Click "Publish"
6. Wait 1-2 minutes for rules to propagate
7. Sign out and sign in again
8. Error should be GONE!

**Answer:** ‚úÖ **Using DEVNET (correct for development)**

```javascript
const connection = new solanaWeb3.Connection(solanaWeb3.clusterApiUrl('devnet'));
